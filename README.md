# README: FitzHugh-Nagumo Model Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing the dynamics of the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) system, both in its regular form and a mass-conserved variant. These models are widely used to study excitable systems, such as neural activity and chemical oscillations. The code here allows users to explore how conservation laws affect wave propagation and pattern formation.

## Features
- Implements both the **regular** and **mass-conserved** FitzHugh-Nagumo equations.
- Provides numerical solvers for simulating spatiotemporal dynamics.
- Includes tools for **stability analysis**, **bifurcation studies**, and **pattern formation exploration**.
- Supports **finite difference** and **spectral methods** for solving the equations.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python and the required numerical libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

### 3. Running Simulations
- To simulate the **regular** FHN system:
  ```bash
  xx
  ```
- To simulate the **mass-conserved** FHN system:
  ```bash
  xx
  ```

### 4. Visualization
The scripts generate plots of **wave dynamics**, **pattern formation**, and **bifurcation structures**. Results are saved in the `results/` folder.

## Code Structure
- `code/` - Contains implementation of the FHN models and solvers.
- `data/` - Stores simulation results.
- `docs/` - Includes theoretical background and documentation.
- `results/` - Holds output visualizations from simulations.

## Analysis and Interpretation
### Stability Analysis
Perform a **linear stability analysis** to identify bifurcation points and determine how parameters affect system behavior.

### Pattern Formation
Simulate spatially extended versions of the models to investigate:
- Wave speed and shape differences.
- The onset of instability and spatial patterns.
- The impact of mass conservation on robustness and structure formation.
