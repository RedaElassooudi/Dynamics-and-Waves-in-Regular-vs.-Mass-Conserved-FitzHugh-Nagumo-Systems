# Comparing Dynamics in Regular and Mass-Conserved FitzHugh-Nagumo Systems

## Project Overview
This project explores the differences in local dynamics and spatial wave pattern formation between the regular and mass-conserved FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) systems. The FHN model is a fundamental system used to study excitable dynamics, with applications in neuroscience, chemical oscillations, and active matter physics. By analyzing how mass conservation influences pattern formation, this project aims to provide insights into the broader implications for active matter systems.

## Motivation
The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a well-known framework for studying excitable media. Recent research has highlighted the role of conservation laws in shaping dynamical behavior, particularly in active matter systems that exhibit non-reciprocal and non-equilibrium interactions. The mass-conserved version of the FHN model shares mathematical similarities with the non-reciprocally coupled Cahn-Hilliard equation, making it an ideal candidate for studying the effects of conservation laws on pattern formation.

## Main Question
How do the regular and mass-conserved FitzHugh-Nagumo systems differ in their local dynamics and the formation of spatial wave patterns?

## Getting Started
### 1. Local Dynamics Analysis
Perform a linear stability analysis of the homogeneous steady states for both models, identifying key differences in stability and bifurcation behavior.

### 2. Spatial Pattern Formation
Simulate spatially extended versions of both models to explore wave propagation and pattern formation using numerical methods such as:
- Finite difference methods
- Spectral methods

### 3. Comparing Dynamics
Investigate how mass conservation influences:
- Wave speed and shape
- Onset of instability and pattern wavelength
- Robustness to parameter variations

### 4. Connection to Active Matter
Discuss the implications of mass conservation in the FHN model for active matter systems, highlighting similarities to the non-reciprocally coupled Cahn-Hilliard equation.

## Suggested Analyses
- Compare bifurcation structures (Hopf and Turing bifurcations) between the two models.
- Analyze the robustness of wave patterns to noise and parameter perturbations.

## Conclusion
This project provides an opportunity to study the impact of conservation laws on excitable dynamics and pattern formation. By comparing the regular and mass-conserved FHN systems, we gain deeper insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing pattern emergence, with potential applications to active matter and beyond.
